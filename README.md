# Skin-Cancer-Prediction
This project presents a deep learning-based skin cancer classification model that identifies different types of skin cancer from dermatology image data using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). The model is trained to support early and accurate diagnosis, which is critical for timely medical intervention.

üîç Project Overview
	‚Ä¢	Built a CNN model from scratch using TensorFlow and Keras to classify skin lesions.
	‚Ä¢	Used a publicly available dermatology image dataset, preprocessed and augmented for better model generalization.
	‚Ä¢	Achieved high classification accuracy by optimizing the model architecture and hyperparameters.
	‚Ä¢	Integrated evaluation metrics like Precision, Recall, F1-score, and Confusion Matrix to validate performance.
	‚Ä¢	Developed an interactive UI for users to upload skin images and receive instant predictions about potential skin cancer risk.

üéØ Key Features
	‚Ä¢	Image classification into multiple skin cancer types.
	‚Ä¢	Real-time prediction system through a user-friendly interface.
	‚Ä¢	Performance-optimized model using dropout layers and data augmentation techniques.
	‚Ä¢	Reproducible codebase with detailed instructions and model files.

üß∞ Tech Stack
	‚Ä¢	Languages: Python
	‚Ä¢	Libraries: TensorFlow, Keras, OpenCV, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn
	‚Ä¢	Tools: Jupyter Notebook / Colab
	‚Ä¢	Interface: (If applicable, mention Streamlit or Flask for frontend)

üìÅ Dataset
	‚Ä¢	The dataset contains thousands of dermatological images with labeled skin conditions.
	‚Ä¢	Preprocessing steps included resizing, normalization, augmentation, and class balancing.
